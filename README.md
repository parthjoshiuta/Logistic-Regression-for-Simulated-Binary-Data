# Logistic-Regression-for-Simulated-Binary-Data

<b>Problem Statement :</b> Implement Logistic Regression for Simulated binary Data
from multivariate normal distribution

<b>Language Used :</b> Python

<b>External Libraries Used :</b> Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn

<b>Activation Function :</b> Sigmoid

<b>Objective Function :</b> Cross Entropy

<b>Dataset :</b> Simulated Binary Data From Multivariate Normal Distribution

## Instructions to Run :

The program does not require you to do anything. Once the files are extracted,
you will need to import all the external libraries in the interpreter.
Once the libraries are successfully imported, you can directly run the program in
order to see the results.

## Comments :
I have printed all the iterations which shows that it minimizes the cost.
After running the code multiple times, the program has achieved an accuracy of
approximately 96% for both training as well as testing.
